# 02 Advanced CSS: Professional Portfolio

This portfolio of work showcases my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. This portfolio highlights my initial work as well as the thought processes behind it. This is effort to build a strong portfolio with multiple deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 

With these points in mind, I have set up for for future success by applying the core skills I recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I practiced these skills by creating something that will be needed during job search.

I didn't have enough web applications to showcase at this time since I am new coder. So I add placeholder images and names for future additions.
